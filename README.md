# Try It Editor Offline

This is a wysiwyg "live" offline html editor. It is derived from [Try It Editor v3.3](http://www.learningslack.com/html/tryitfb35.html?filename=tryhtml_default) and [Try It Editor v3.5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default).

It uses:
 - Fontello fonts
 - w3.css
 - codemirror.css
 - `Codemirror.js`
 - `FileSaver.js`

Main differences from original **Try It Editor v3.5** :
 - It updates preview at every key stroke
 - When divider is moved it preserves its position
 - It is possible to download previewed html
 - It can show the HTML source in a different tab/window

Due to origin restrisctions of the browsers, you can not save the document wherever you want and load one from wherever you want. What you should do is: download the document to the directory of this editor; load the document from the same directory of this editor, otherwise you will not be able to modify the loaded file.
